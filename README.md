# MSA Energy App 

A energy app designed which was part of the Microsoft Student Accelerator course at the University Of Auckland. The aim was to create a simple React-Typescript application which would interface with an external API. In this implementation the Electricity Authority API was used to connect too and interface with to display New Zealand energy data.
